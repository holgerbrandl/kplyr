`kplyr` is a grammar of data manipulation and conceptionally a blunt clone of the amazing [`dplyr`](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) for [R](https://www.r-project.org/)/. `kplyr` is written in [Kotlin]() and mimics the API of `dplyr` as much as possible while adding a more typed approach where possible.

`kplyr` allows to manipulate and combine tabluar data.
